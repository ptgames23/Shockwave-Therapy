RESPONSIVE OBJECT ELEMENTS,TOOLTIPS,
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~,
responseObj,Experimenter tooltip,
responseSeq,Experimenter tooltip,
Characteristics,Object Characteristics allow you to change how the object will appear and interact with the environment and other objects. Assign a tag to the Responsive Object for interaction responses with other Responsive Objects. Add Object Properties to track custom variables and create property exchanges with other Responsive objects. A unique Object Property instance is created for each Responsive Object in an environment.  ,
InputResponseMaps,Add Input-Response maps that allow the object to be controlled using Keyboard & Mouse and/or Gamepads and/or XR Controllers. Responsive Objects can have multiple types of Input-Response Maps allowing them to be controlled by multiple input devices; a feature that allows for plug-and-play input,
InteractionResponses,Interaction Responses allow the object to respond in a variety of ways when another object comes within a certain range. On Connection Responses are executed once when an object with the define tag(s) gets within the define range. While Connected Responses are executed once per frame while the other object is within the define range. On Disconnection Responses are executed once when an object leaves the defined range.,
PropertyResponses,"Property Responses monitor the defined property and responses are executed when the Property Condition is met. If the Property Condition become unmet, the Responses will execute again if the condition is met once again.",
MachineLearning,Machine Learning allows the Responsive Object to be controlled via the Python API by defining the state observations that will be sent to your custom python scirpt each frame and the Machine Learning Action-Space allows you to define what actions are available to relay back to the Responsive object. This allows experiments to be transformed into AI gyms that can be used to reinforcement learning models.,
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~,~~~~~~~~~~~~~,

SlopeLimit,Specify the maximum slope this Responsive Object can climb up ,
StepOffset,Specify the maximum step height this Responsive Object can take,
ForwardBackward,Using Input-Response maps, Responsive objects have the ability to pickup and drop other responsive objects. The held object offset lets you adjust the relative position between the Responsive Object and the object it is holding. You can adjust the held offset when the Responsive Object is holding another object in Run Mode making it easy to find the best setting.

SCENESCAPE ELEMENTS,TOOLTIPS,
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~,
scenescape,Experimenter tooltip,
ScenescapeObjects,"Create Scenescape by adding single objects, or multiple of the same object within a defined area. When adding multiple objects you can define the minimum distance (padding) between them and randomize their features; a feature which for example allows you quickly create forests and other natural characteristics. Scenescapes can also contain other Scenescapes; a feature which allows you to quickly rearange large sections of an environment relative to one another. Use the Group feature when you wish to counterbalance object-location placementments.",
ScenescapeAudio,Add audio to different areas of your Scenescape scapes to create multimodel contextual boundaries or to enhance emersion. Audio range dictates the area the audio can be heard in and audio fade allows the volume of the audio to increase/decrease the closer/further the participant gets to the center of the audio placement.,
